*An IoT-based AI system for real-time suspicious activity detection using YOLO, CNN, LSTM on Raspberry Pi with nightvision camera. Features multi-mode alerts, secure remote access, and selective storage*
</br>
</br>

## Overview

PiLENS is a Raspberry Pi-based deep learning enhanced night vision surveillance system I developed to provide intelligent, real-time suspicious activity detection in low-light and night-time environments. It combines the edge computing power of the Raspberry Pi with advanced computer vision and deep learning algorithms to create a smart, cost-effective security solution. Unlike conventional CCTV systems that rely on human monitoring or basic motion detection, PiLENS uses AI to identify potentially suspicious behavior with better accuracy and fewer false alarms. By integrating infrared imaging and night vision enhancement, it works reliably even in tough lighting conditions where regular cameras struggle.
<br>
The main goal of PiLENS is to make high-tech surveillance affordable and accessible for places like academic institutions, residential areas, warehouses, and other security-sensitive spots. It bridges the gap between cost and intelligence by offering portable, scalable monitoring that minimizes manual effort. With real-time video processing, automated detection, and alert generation, it boosts situational awareness. Its modular design allows for expansions like audio anomaly detection, wireless modules, cloud integration, and multi-camera support. Overall, PiLENS is a practical step toward smarter surveillance that's both user-friendly and technologically solid.
<br>
What makes PiLENS stand out is its multi-mode detection system, where it handles basic person alerts, intruder face recognition, and advanced suspicious activity analysis all in one. It also has selective storage to save only suspicious clips, saving space, and secure remote access via Tailscale for hack-proof viewing from anywhere. Running at 5 FPS on low-cost hardware, it's optimized for efficiency without compromising performance.
</br>
Key components include:
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM) as the core processor, Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (12MP NOIR with IR LEDs for nightvision), LEDs and buzzer for local alerts.
- Software: Ultralytics YOLO for person detection, CNN for feature extraction, LSTM for sequence analysis, and Flask for remote MJPEG streaming.
- Features: Multi-mode detection (basic person alert, intruder face recognition, advanced suspicious analysis), selective storage of suspicious clips, and secure remote access via Tailscale.
- Performance: Runs at 5 FPS to balance heavy ML processing on low-power hardware.

This project aims to provide a low-cost, portable solution for enhanced security, with potential extensions for audio detection and long-range wireless connectivity.

## Motivational Scenario
### The Problem: Growing Security Concerns

In modern institutional environments such as universities, libraries, laboratories, and campus entry points, security threats are becoming increasingly complex. Traditional surveillance systems rely heavily on human operators to continuously monitor multiple camera feeds. However, manual monitoring is prone to human fatigue, delayed reaction time, and oversight errors.

- Security personnel often face challenges such as:
- Continuous monitoring of multiple camera streams
- Blurred or low-visibility feeds during nighttime
- Delayed identification of suspicious activities
- Inability to respond instantly to threats

As a result, many incidents are detected too late, reducing the overall effectiveness of surveillance infrastructure.

### Limitations of Manual Monitoring

Manual surveillance systems suffer from several practical limitations:

1. Time-Consuming Observation – Monitoring multiple screens simultaneously is mentally exhausting.
2. Human Error – Fatigue can cause missed detections.
3. Delayed Response – Suspicious activity may not be noticed immediately.
4. Poor Night Visibility – Standard cameras struggle in low-light conditions.

These limitations clearly indicate the need for a smarter and more automated surveillance approach.


### The Need for a Smart Surveillance Solution

With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and embedded systems, there is a strong need to shift from passive monitoring to intelligent monitoring.

An ideal system should:
- Automatically detect unusual activities
- Operate efficiently in low-light or night conditions
- Send real-time alerts
- Reduce dependency on constant human supervision
- Provide faster response time

This gap between traditional systems and intelligent automation forms the core motivation behind PiLENS.


### Our Solution: PiLENS (Vigilant Eye)

PiLENS is an AI-powered smart surveillance system designed to enhance security monitoring using modern embedded hardware and intelligent algorithms.

The system integrates:
- Infrared (IR) Camera for night vision capability
- Raspberry Pi 5 as the central processing unit
- AI-based detection algorithms
- Real-time alert mechanism via Wi-Fi
- Automated threat notification system

Unlike traditional systems, PiLENS does not rely solely on human observation. Instead, it continuously analyzes live feeds, detects anomalies, and instantly notifies the concerned authority when suspicious activity is identified.

## Problem Statement

Traditional surveillance systems in universities and public institutions rely heavily on continuous human monitoring of CCTV footage. This manual monitoring approach is inefficient, prone to human error, and often results in delayed response to suspicious activities. Security personnel cannot effectively observe multiple camera feeds simultaneously for extended periods, which increases the risk of unnoticed incidents.</br>

Furthermore, most existing surveillance systems lack intelligent behavior analysis and automated alert mechanisms. They only record footage without actively identifying abnormal or suspicious patterns. This creates a significant gap between incident occurrence and response time.</br>

There is a need for an intelligent, automated, and real-time surveillance system that can monitor environments continuously, detect suspicious activities using AI techniques, and instantly alert authorities. The system should also function effectively during low-light or nighttime conditions.</br>

VigilantEye aims to address these challenges by integrating artificial intelligence with hardware-based surveillance to provide real-time detection, automated alerts, and enhanced security monitoring.</br>

### Current Situation

Universities rely on CCTV systems that require constant human supervision.

### Problem

Human monitoring is inefficient and error-prone.

### Gap

Existing systems lack AI-based real-time suspicious activity detection.

### Impact

Delayed detection may lead to security threats and property damage.

### Proposed Need

An automated AI-powered surveillance system is required.
