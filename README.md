## Motivational Scenario
### The Problem: Growing Security Concerns

In modern institutional environments such as universities, libraries, laboratories, and campus entry points, security threats are becoming increasingly complex. Traditional surveillance systems rely heavily on human operators to continuously monitor multiple camera feeds. However, manual monitoring is prone to human fatigue, delayed reaction time, and oversight errors.

- Security personnel often face challenges such as:
- Continuous monitoring of multiple camera streams
- Blurred or low-visibility feeds during nighttime
- Delayed identification of suspicious activities
- Inability to respond instantly to threats

As a result, many incidents are detected too late, reducing the overall effectiveness of surveillance infrastructure.

### Limitations of Manual Monitoring

Manual surveillance systems suffer from several practical limitations:

1. Time-Consuming Observation – Monitoring multiple screens simultaneously is mentally exhausting.
2. Human Error – Fatigue can cause missed detections.
3. Delayed Response – Suspicious activity may not be noticed immediately.
4. Poor Night Visibility – Standard cameras struggle in low-light conditions.

These limitations clearly indicate the need for a smarter and more automated surveillance approach.


### The Need for a Smart Surveillance Solution

With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and embedded systems, there is a strong need to shift from passive monitoring to intelligent monitoring.

An ideal system should:
- Automatically detect unusual activities
- Operate efficiently in low-light or night conditions
- Send real-time alerts
- Reduce dependency on constant human supervision
- Provide faster response time

This gap between traditional systems and intelligent automation forms the core motivation behind PiLENS.


### Our Solution: PiLENS (Vigilant Eye)

PiLENS is an AI-powered smart surveillance system designed to enhance security monitoring using modern embedded hardware and intelligent algorithms.

The system integrates:
- Infrared (IR) Camera for night vision capability
- Raspberry Pi 5 as the central processing unit
- AI-based detection algorithms
- Real-time alert mechanism via Wi-Fi
- Automated threat notification system

Unlike traditional systems, PiLENS does not rely solely on human observation. Instead, it continuously analyzes live feeds, detects anomalies, and instantly notifies the concerned authority when suspicious activity is identified.

## Problem Statement

Traditional surveillance systems in universities and public institutions rely heavily on continuous human monitoring of CCTV footage. This manual monitoring approach is inefficient, prone to human error, and often results in delayed response to suspicious activities. Security personnel cannot effectively observe multiple camera feeds simultaneously for extended periods, which increases the risk of unnoticed incidents.</br>

Furthermore, most existing surveillance systems lack intelligent behavior analysis and automated alert mechanisms. They only record footage without actively identifying abnormal or suspicious patterns. This creates a significant gap between incident occurrence and response time.</br>

There is a need for an intelligent, automated, and real-time surveillance system that can monitor environments continuously, detect suspicious activities using AI techniques, and instantly alert authorities. The system should also function effectively during low-light or nighttime conditions.</br>

VigilantEye aims to address these challenges by integrating artificial intelligence with hardware-based surveillance to provide real-time detection, automated alerts, and enhanced security monitoring.</br>

### Current Situation

Universities rely on CCTV systems that require constant human supervision.

### Problem

Human monitoring is inefficient and error-prone.

### Gap

Existing systems lack AI-based real-time suspicious activity detection.

### Impact

Delayed detection may lead to security threats and property damage.

### Proposed Need

An automated AI-powered surveillance system is required.

## System Architecture

The VigilantEye system is designed as an integrated IoT-based surveillance platform that combines hardware components, software modules, and AI-driven processing to enable real-time suspicious activity detection. The architecture is modular, allowing for scalability and future expansions such as audio integration or long-range wireless connectivity. It leverages the edge computing capabilities of the Raspberry Pi to perform on-device analysis, reducing latency and enhancing privacy by minimizing data transmission to external servers. The system is divided into three main layers: Input Layer, Processing Layer, and Output Layer.

### Input Layer

This layer handles data acquisition from IoT devices and sensors. The primary input is the video stream from the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (12MP NOIR with IR LEDs and LDR illuminator), which enables nightvision functionality for low-light environments. The camera captures high-resolution footage at 5 FPS to balance performance and resource usage on the Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM). Additional inputs include potential microphone data for audio detection (e.g., suspicious sounds like glass breaking or shouting), though this is planned for future extensions. Secure remote access is facilitated through Tailscale, which provides a VPN-like IP for worldwide monitoring without compromising security. All inputs are fed directly to the core processing unit, ensuring realtime data flow.

### Processing Layer

At the heart of the system is the Raspberry Pi 5, serving as the central microcontroller and edge device. It processes the input streams using a multi-stage AI pipeline:

- Person/Object Detection: Utilizes the Ultralytics YOLO model to identify persons and generate bounding boxes in the video feed, with a confidence threshold of 0.60 to reduce false positives.
- Feature Extraction and Analysis: The bounding box data is passed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction (e.g., motion patterns or unusual behaviors). This is followed by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks via PyTorch for temporal sequence analysis, determining if the activity is normal or suspicious.
- Multi-Mode Operation: The system operates in three modes:
  - Mode 1 (Basic Person Alert): Immediate detection of any person triggers an alert without deep analysis.
  - Mode 2 (Intruder Face Recognition): Uses face recognition to check if the person is authorized; unauthorized triggers specific alerts.
  - Mode 3 (Advanced Suspicious Detection): Full YOLO-CNN-LSTM pipeline for detailed behavior analysis.
- Selective Storage: Only suspicious clips are saved to the "Intruders" folder, optimizing storage on the high-resolution camera output.
- The processing is optimized for 5 FPS to prevent overload on the low-power Raspberry Pi, with all computations performed on-device for edge efficiency.

### Output Layer

This layer manages alerts and user interaction. Upon detection, the system generates multi-modal alerts:

- Email notifications with timestamps, location details, attached snapshots, and video clips (using smtplib for async sending).
- Local indicators via GPIO-connected red/green LEDs and buzzer for immediate feedback (e.g., red LED and buzzer for intruders).
- Voice TTS alerts (using pyttsx3 for spoken warnings).
- The PyQt6-based desktop GUI provides a user interface for starting/stopping monitoring, viewing logs, browsing intruder files, toggling themes (dark/light), and controlling Tailscale/Flask for remote MJPEG streaming (accessible at http://[IP]:8000/video).
- Logging and notifications are stored securely, with options for future cloud integration.

The architecture emphasizes low-cost, portability, and security, making it suitable for military or civil applications. It uses Flask for streaming and Tailscale for encrypted remote access, ensuring hack-proof operation. Future enhancements include audio anomaly detection and NRF-based long-distance wireless connectivity to extend the system's range.
